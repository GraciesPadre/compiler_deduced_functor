I've taken an interest in functional program over the past year or so, and, more specifically,
    the sweet spot that balances functional with object-oriented.  As part of that, I've been looking at the
    functional capabilities that have been added to what you might normally think of as imperative
    languages.  C++ has had at least some form of functional programming for along time in its
    ability to use function pointers and call operators.  Lambdas are a more recent addition to the language, and
    I've been using them more frequently when I define my own APIs.

The more I use the FP aspects of C++, the more I have come to value it as a legitimate
tool in the toolbox.
